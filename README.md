# easy_to_maintain

Notebooks are great, they allow to explore your data and prototype models quickly. But they make it hard to follow good software practices. The goal is to see how to refactor our code as a testable and maintainable Python package with entry-points to tune, train and test our model so it can easily be integrated to a CI/CD flow.
